# Applications

This section outlines a sample $(a)$ problem statement, $(b)$ corresponding outcome expectations/underlying aims, and $(c)$ deployment goal vis-à-vis token classification model development.

<br>

## Problem Statement

The problem and why is it important to solve &Rarr;

!!! note "STATEMENT"

    An organisation manually classifies trauma incidents for all the major trauma centres of five countries.  Per trauma case, an injury coding expert <b>(a)</b> examines the case's free and structured text, and assigns each piece of text to a category, and <b>(b)</b> assigns the case to a trauma category based on the combination text pieces & categories detected; text pieces of the other/miscellaneous category are excluded from this exercise.  Trauma injury coding is an extremely intensive and time-consuming exercise, and injury coding error rates - per annum - can be quite high.  Hence, and as a first step, we are in search of a solution that automatically classifies text pieces vis-à-vis a set of provided categories.

## Outcome Expectations, Underlying Aims

The potential product's outcome expectations &Rarr;

!!! note "The outcome expectations"

    Real-time availability of classifications per trauma case.


Underlying aims &Rarr;

!!! note "Hence the underlying aims are"

    The automatic classification of trauma case text pieces; objective &#8594;

    * per case, automatic classification time < 180 seconds.
    * model metrics limits false negative rate &#8804; 0.02, false positive rate &#8804; 0.04

<br>

## Deployment Goal

A potential machine learning dependent project without a deployment goal is directionless, do not proceed without one.
