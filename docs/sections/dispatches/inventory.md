The [membranes hub](https://github.com/membranes) hosts the repositories of a token classification modelling project.  Readers may interact with the model via a [simple open interface](https://greyhypotheses-detecting.hf.space).

The `text` package will be re-written, time and funding permitting.  The
<a href="https://github.com/membranes/restructuring" target="_blank">restructuring</a> repository package is for restructuring the latest data captures in preparation for (a) human inspection, and (b) usage as a model re-training data source.
